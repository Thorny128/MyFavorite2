    <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
    <h2>Reading Books</h2>
    <p>My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after
        completing my home work. I am 13 years old and read in class 7th standard. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make
        me really good. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good
        source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in
        our lives.</p>
